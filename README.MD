### Current ideas

This is gonna be a mix of a 3D Jumpnrun mixed with a small puzzle-ish elements.

To win or clear a level, the player has to deliver a certain object from start to finish.
While doing that, he has to clear several different obstacles while being affected by different debuffs while holding the object such as not being able to jump.
